# XCrypt

## About

This was initially a project to prove that I could make a strong encryption but I decided to publish it so that the internet peoples could improve it and use it. While it is still kinda basic it will get stronger and more efficient.

Install with `pip install xcrypt`

As of 8.17.21 all the functions are in one file. Please see `example.py` for an example of how to use. Thanks to Sigmanificient for some fixes to the initial code.

## To use

To use this project all you need to do is download the code and add it to your python project. Import the files and then use. It's really easy, I designed it that way.

## If there are issues

The only library it requires is random and I think that comes with python. Make sure your using the right key file when encrypting and decrypting. I don't know why it shouldn't work if your doing everything right.
