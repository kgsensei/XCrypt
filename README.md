# XCrypt

## About

This was initially a project to prove that I could make a strong encryption but I decided to publish it so that the internet peoples could improve it and use it. While it is still kinda basic it will get stronger and more efficient.

As of 8.17.21 all the functions are in one file. Please see `example.py` for an example of how to use. Thanks to Sigmanificient for some ideas and inspiration.

## To use

To use this project all you need to do is download the code and add it to your python project. Import the files and then use. It's really easy, I designed it that way.

## If there are issues

The only library it requires is random and I think that comes with python. Make sure your using the right key file when encrypting and decrypting. I don't know why it shouldn't work if your doing everything right.
